Aegon II Targaryen, also known as Aegon the Elder,[8]
 was the sixth Targaryen king to sit the Iron Throne,
 succeeding his father,
 Viserys I Targaryen, 
as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. His ascent was disputed by his older half-sister,
 Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, who had been their father's designated heir.
 Aegon and Rhaenyra fought for the throne in the civil war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons, in which both siblings perished.[9]


Aegon was married to his younger sister, Helaena,
 and had three children by her, though none reached adulthood. His dragon was Sunfyre, also known as "the Golden". 
During the Dance, Aegon took a three-headed golden dragon for his personal sigil instead of the red three-headed Targaryen dragon,[9]
 indicating his mount.[7] Aegon's supporters used his personal heraldry as their battle-flag.[9]


Ser Brynden Rivers, called "Lord Bloodraven", was the bastard son of King Aegon IV Targaryen by his sixth mistress,
 Lady Melissa Blackwood. He had two older sisters, Mya and Gwenys, and numerous half-siblings.[8] 
As his mother was highborn, Brynden was counted among the Great Bastards. Like his bastard siblings, 
Brynden was legitimized by King Aegon IV in 184 AC. Brynden's personal arms were a white dragon with red eyes breathing red flame on a black field.

Brynden was a Targaryen loyalist during the Blackfyre Rebellions.[10] 
He served as the Hand of the King to King Aerys I Targaryen[1] and King Maekar I Targaryen.[6]
 He was eventually sent to the Night's Watch by King Aegon V Targaryen, where he rose to the position of Lord Commander.[11
