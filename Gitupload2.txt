Aegon II Targaryen, also known as Aegon the Elder,[8]
 was the sixth Targaryen king to sit the Iron Throne,
 succeeding his father,
 Viserys I Targaryen, 
as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. His ascent was disputed by his older half-sister,
 Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, who had been their father's designated heir.
 Aegon and Rhaenyra fought for the throne in the civil war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons, in which both siblings perished.[9]


Aegon was married to his younger sister, Helaena,
 and had three children by her, though none reached adulthood. His dragon was Sunfyre, also known as "the Golden". 
During the Dance, Aegon took a three-headed golden dragon for his personal sigil instead of the red three-headed Targaryen dragon,[9]
 indicating his mount.[7] Aegon's supporters used his personal heraldry as their battle-flag.[9]
